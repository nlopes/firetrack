Feature: Expenses
  In order to keep track of my expenses
  As a user
  I want to enter, manage and view my expenses

  @javascript
  Scenario: Add an expense
    Given I am logged in as "pallas.park@email.gr"
    And I click "Expenses" in the "sidebar navigation"
    Then I should see the heading "Expenses"
    And I should be on "/expenses"
    When I click "Add expense"
    Then I should be on "/expenses/add"
    And I should see the heading "Add expense"
    And the "Amount" field should not contain a value
    And the "Category" hierarchical dropdown should not be expanded
    And the "Date" field should contain today's date

    When I fill in "Amount" with "99.95"
    And I select the "Groceries" option in the "Category" hierarchical dropdown
    And I fill in "Date" with "2020-02-21"
    And I press "Add"
    #Then I should see the success message "Added â‚¬99.95 expense to the Internet category."
    #And I should have 1 expense
